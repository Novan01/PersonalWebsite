                <h4>Fire and Emergency Response VR Simulation</h4>
                <p>
                    This was a project I worked on for 2 years during high school. Our local fire department had asked our class of computer science students in the 3rd year, and animation students
                    to create a new training simulation for them. They were currently training using old maps and driving the firetruck around the city. They wanted to do something enjoyable and cheap.
                    Our school created this class through the support of our computer science and animation teachers and began working on it in 2017. When I joined in 2018 I was on the programming team
                    working on the physics of the firetruck, attaching addresses to the locations of houses in the real world locations. That summer my sister and I got the privilage to speak at a convetion in San Diego 
                    for Esri. The next year I became the project lead, I managed all the students and conducted meetings regularly to keep on task. I also managed the file systems and really putting together
                    the project as a whole. We were invited to speak at a convention in Orlando, Florida which unfortunatley I couldn't attend due to the sponsors specific requests.
