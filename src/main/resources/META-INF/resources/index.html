                <h4>Fire and Emergency Response VR Simulation</h4>
                <p>
                    This was a project I worked on for 2 years during high school. Our local fire department had asked our class of computer science students in the 3rd year, and animation students
                    to create a new training simulation for them. They were currently training using old maps and driving the firetruck around the city. They wanted to do something enjoyable and cheap.
                    Our school created this class through the support of our computer science and animation teachers and began working on it in 2017. When I joined in 2018 I was on the programming team
                    working on the physics of the firetruck, attaching addresses to the locations of houses in the real world locations. That summer my sister and I got the privilage to speak at a convetion in San Diego 
                    for Esri. The next year I became the project lead, I managed all the students and conducted meetings regularly to keep on task. I also managed the file systems and really putting together
                    the project as a whole. We were invited to speak at a convention in Orlando, Florida which unfortunatley I couldn't attend due to the sponsors specific requests.

                <p>
                    During the summer of 2020, a few friends and I participated in an international GameJam sponsored by Sogeti, a tech division of
                    Capgemini, sponsored by Intel. The goal of the event was to create a game in 48 hours to promote protecting biodiversity. My team created a game called The Collector
                    and with it we won the caption award "Best Sustainable Code". Our code was described as "precise, clean, and efficient" by the judges.

                <p>
                    This was a project given for my Software Engineering course. The goal was to simulate the SDLC of a product from conception to deployment.
                    The project my team did is a Scheduling Application built in Java using Java Applets and SQL for data storage. The semester finished before the project
                    could be finished in its entierty. The project currently has a functioning calendar, non-functional login page, and basic SQL database connection. I was responsible
                    for writing the code, and managing my team to make sure we were all on track. I also wrote our Architectural Logical View, and our Class Diagram.
                    I also did the final analysis of our code using CodeMR.

                <h4>Text Based RPG | Quarkus</h4>
                <p>
                    This was a small summer project that is still a work in progress that I intend on coming back to when time permits. The idea is a Web-Based
                    text adventure written in html, css, javascript and running on Quarkus where the player could connect to the site and play a randomly generated game
                    using AI, specifically ChatGPT, to create diverse worlds and stories as well as responsive and dynamic NPC's.

                    This was the orinigal summer project written entirely in Java. This project was to be an applet text adventure someone could run on their local
                    machine that used Java as the main lanugage, and also integrated MongoDB to store character and game information. This project was to play around with database connection
                    and character creation saved to a json file.

                <h4>Lazy Deletion in a Binary Search Tree</h4>
                <p>
                    This project was a good practice in advanced algorithm techniques. I created a program to create a binary search Tree
                    that would allow the user to insert items into the tree and mark items to be lazily deleted. This is a strong application in many forms
                    of file systems, supply chain systems, and many forms of software.
